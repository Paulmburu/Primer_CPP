if you are a Linux enthusiast and are interested in what features from the early days
of Linux have survived, an interesting read is Dennis Ritchie’s reprint of the first UNIX

The form of this
documentation is UNIX man pages, which is still the primary format for documenting UNIX
and Linux operating system commands and programming tools today.
