*iter           Returns a reference to the element denoted by the iterator iter.
iter->mem       Deferences iter and fetches the member named mem from the
	        underlying element. Equivalent to (*iter) .mem.
++iter          increments iter to refer to the next element in the container.
--iter          Decrements iter to refer to the previous element in the
                container.
iter1 == iter2  compares two iterators for equality(inequality). Two iterators
	        are equal.
iter1 != iter2  if they denote the same element or if they are the off-the-end 
                iterator for the same container.
